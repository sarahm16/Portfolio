                    Hello, my name is Sarah and I aspire to be a web developer. When I was in kindergarten, I told my parents that I wanted to be a doctor of sorts. Over the years, the field I wanted to work in would change from obstetrician to brain surgeon to anesthesiologist, etc. But the main goal was always the same, I was going to be a doctor. So I went through the motions. I completed the rigorous undergrad curriculum with excellent grades, I took the MCAT, and I even worked at a pain management clinic for a period of time.
                    But something always told me to have a backup plan in case medicine didn't work out. I decided to major in Mathematics because math has been my favorite subject since elementary school. That's when I stumbled upon programming. I took several applied math classes and even a computer science engineering course in undergrad and fell in love.
                    But I was still determined to become a doctor, because I am not one to change course before my goal was complete. When I worked in the medical field, I realized that I was only pursuing a PhD because of how difficult it is and I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it.
                    In my heart, I knew it wasn't the right field for me and that I wouldn't be happy as a doctor.
                    
                    <br>

                    So here I am, currently studying web development at UW and loving it. Every day is a challenge. Every day I learn something new and it's uncomfortable, but I know that I'm making progress quickly. The challenge is what keeps me going and I can't get enough of it.
